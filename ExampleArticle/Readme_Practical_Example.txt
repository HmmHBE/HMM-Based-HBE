The current folder contains the following items:
1- The directory "./Results/" containing the all the experimental results of this pratical example. 
   This directory contains the following elements:
   
      a- The files 'results_Kappa_1.txt' and 'results_Kappa_3.txt'  containing the 
	     resulting long Markov chains (MCs) like those depicted in the Figures 7.a 
		 and 7.b of [1] for (KAPPA = 1) and (KAPPA = 3) respectivelly. 
		 The number of samples, the maximum angle and the maximum distance of each 
		 statokinesigram are also displayed.
		 
      b- The file 'SubjectVectors.txt'  containing the final vector u_KAPPA as 
	     presented in the Table 9 of [1]. Given that the values presented in 
		 Tables 7, 8 and 9 of [1] has been truncated to two decimal places, they 
		 may differ slightly from the values appearing in file the 'SubjectVectors.txt'.
		 
      c- The directories "./Firm_Kappa_1/" and "./Firm_Kappa_3/"  containing the results 
	     of the execution of the method proposed in [1] with (KAPPA = 1) and (KAPPA = 3).
		 
2- Three source codes ('Stabilo.c', 'hmm.h' and 'Stabilo.h') used to run the method proposed in [1].

3- The directory "./Test/"  containing the raw input statokinesigrams in the organized format. 
   This directory is used as input directory during the execution of the method proposed in [1]. 
   All the results are thus saved in this same directory. 
____________________________________________________________________________________________   

To run the method proposed in [1] in order to obtain the results contained in the 
subdirectory "./Results/", the program "./Stabilo.c" is compiled and executed as follow:

The compilation command line of the program 'Stabilo.c' is:

   gcc -Wall -Wl,--stack,536870912 -o Stabilo.exe Stabilo.c

After the compilation, the execution command line:

   Stabilo.exe DirectoryName FreqDiv TimeShift NbSamples MaxIterations Threshold SaveHMMs
   
Where:   
   
    1- 'DirectoryName' is the name of a folder containing the input dataset in the organized format. 
	  The subdirectory "./Test/" was used in [1] for this purpose.  
    2- 'FreqDiv' is the parameter SIGMA of down-sampling step explained in Section 4.2 of [1].
    3- 'TimeShift' is the desired time-shift.
    4- 'NbSamples' is the number N used in the Equation 3 of [1] to split the interval [0, 100].
    5- 'MaxIterations' is the maximum number of iterations for the Baum-Welch algorithm.
    6- 'Threshold' is the threshold belonging to [0, 100] and corresponding to the learning rate of the Baum-Welch algorithm.
    7- 'SaveHMMs' is a binary parameter such that (SaveHMMs=0) if we do not want to record the resulting HMMs in a textfile, 
	  otherwise (SaveHMMs=1).
		  
Thus, the typical example of execution command line for (KAPPA=1) is: 
      
   Stabilo.exe Test 1 1 10 100 100.0 1
		  
And the typical example of execution command line for (KAPPA=3) is: 
      
   Stabilo.exe Test 1 3 10 100 100.0 1
   
Details related to the outputs of this programs are available in the helpfile 
'../Santos_and_Duarte/HMM_learning/Readme_HMM_learning.txt'.
