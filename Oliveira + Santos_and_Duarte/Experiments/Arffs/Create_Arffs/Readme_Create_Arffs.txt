To create the '.arff' files for the experiments involving one single value of the
time-shift KAPPA (e.g., KAPPA = 1, 5, 10) as it is done [1], you must compile then
run the program 'MakeArffs.c' located in the three following subdirectories:
  - "./Shift_1/"
  - "./Shift_5/"
  - "./Shift_10/"

The compilation command line of that program is:

   gcc -Wall -o MakeArffs.exe MakeArffs.c

After the compilation, the execution command line:

   MakeArffs.exe PositiveFile NegativeFile NoIllnessFile zcore
   
Where:   
      1- 'PositiveFile' is the file containing 32 the final vectors generated by the
	     approach proposed in [1] for the subjects suffering from the Parkinson's 
		 disease. These vectors were extracted from the dataset proposed by Oliveira et al. in [2].
		 The file 'Positive_Vectors.txt' was used in [1].
      2- 'NegativeFile' is the file containing 163 the final vectors generated by the
	     approach proposed in [1] for all the subjects of the dataset proposed by Santos & Duarte in [3].
		 The file 'Negative_Vectors.txt' was used in [1].
      3- 'NoIllnessFile' is the file containing the identifiers of the 57 subjects of 
	     the dataset proposed by Santos & Duarte in [3] who declared no illness.
		 The file 'No_illness.txt' was used in [1].
      4- 'zcore' is an integer determining if z-score scaling must be applied to correct batch effects
	     (zcore != 0) or must not be applied (zcore = 0).
		  
Thus, the typical example of execution command line 
WITH application of the z-score scaling is: 
   
   MakeArffs.exe Positive_Vectors.txt Negative_Vectors.txt No_illness.txt 1

This command produces as output the file 'Parkinson_zscore.arff' that was renamed as 
'Parkinson_zscore$N$_shift_$KAPPA$.arff' then copied in the subdirectories 
"../Arff_Files/with_zscore$N$/" where:
    1- N is the number of samples of the interval [0,100]. The value (N=10) was used in [1].
	2- KAPPA is the time-shift. The values (KAPPA = 1, 5, 10) were used in [1].

The typical example of execution command line 
WITHOUT application of the z-score scaling is: 
   
   MakeArffs.exe Positive_Vectors.txt Negative_Vectors.txt No_illness.txt 0

This command produces as output the file 'Parkinson.arff' that was renamed as 
'Parkinson$N$_shift_$KAPPA$.arff' then copied in the subdirectories 
"../Arff_Files/without_zscore$N$/" where:
    1- N is the number of samples of the interval [0,100]. The value (N=10) was used in [1].
	2- KAPPA is the time-shift. The values (KAPPA = 1, 5, 10) were used in [1].
________________________________________________________________________________________________   

To create the '.arff' files for the experiments involving several values of the
time-shift KAPPA (e.g., KAPPA = {1,5},{1,10},{5,10},{1,5,10}) as it is done [1], you must compile then
run the program 'MergeArffs.c' located in the eight following subdirectories:
  - "./Shift_1_5/with_zscore10/"
  - "./Shift_1_5/without_zscore10/"
  - "./Shift_1_10/with_zscore10/"
  - "./Shift_1_10/without_zscore10/"
  - "./Shift_5_10/with_zscore10/"
  - "./Shift_5_10/without_zscore10/"
  - "./Shift_1_5_10/with_zscore10"
  - "./Shift_1_5_10/without_zscore10/"

The compilation command line of that program is:

   gcc -Wall -o MergeArffs.exe MergeArffs.c

After the compilation, the execution command line:

   MergeArffs.exe File1 File2 ResultFile
   
Where:   
      1- 'File1' and 'File2' are the two '.arff' files that must be merged. 
	      These two files are already available in each corresponding subdirectory.
      2- 'ResultFile' is the resulting '.arff' file. 
		  
Thus, a typical example of execution command line in the 
subdirectory "./Shift_1_5/without_zscore10/" is: 
   
   MergeArffs.exe Parkinson10_Shift_1.arff Parkinson10_Shift_5.arff Parkinson10_Shift_1_5.arff

The resulting output file was renamed accordingly and copied in the suitable
subdirectory among the two following subdirectories  "../Arff_Files/with_zscore$N$/" and 
"../Arff_Files/without_zscore$N$/", where N is the number of samples of the 
interval [0,100]. The value (N=10) was used in [1].
