This folder contains the results of different executions of the method proposed in [1] with various time-shifts(1, 5 and 10) 
It contains the subdirectories "./Shift_$KAPPA$/", with KAPPA = 1, 5 and 10. Each subdirectory has the following items:
   1- The subdirectory "./Shift_$KAPPA$/Organized_Processed/" which contains the dataset proposed in [2] in an organized format 
     alongside with the corresponding experimental results.
   2- The file './Shift_$KAPPA$/SubjectVectors.txt' containing the final vectors of all the subjects in the dataset proposed in [2] after the method described in [1] 
     has been applied on it with the corresponding time-shift.
